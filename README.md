# Graph-Algorithms
Here , I have implemented different Graph algorithms in C++

* LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor using Binary Lifting)

* Bellman Ford (Single Source Shortest Path Algo for graphs with negative edge weights) 

* Bfs (Standard BFS Traversal in Graph)

* Cycle Directed (Cycle detection in a directed graph using DFS) 

* Cycle Undirected (Cycle detection in an Undirected graph using DFS)

* Dfs (Standard DFS traversal in Graph) 

* Dijkstra (Single Source Shortest Path algo for graphs with positive edge weights)

* DSU (Implementation of DSU Data Structure)

* Euler Tour 

* Floyd Warshall (All source shortest Path)

* Kruskal (MST Algorithm)

* Prims (MST Algorithm) 

* Toposort using Bfs

* Toposort Dfs

* Travelling Salesman Problem (DP wth bitmasking)
